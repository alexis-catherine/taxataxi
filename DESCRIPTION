Description: Cross references datasets from iNaturalist and NPSpecies. 
  Observations in iNaturalist are cross-referenced with NPSpecies for the national 
  park unit in which the observation was made, to identify which species observed 
  and documented in iNaturalist are and are not on NPSpecies list for the park in 
  which the observations were made. Taxataxi helps with taxonomy issues by calling 
  in taxonomic synonyms, to determine where species may be the same but under 
  different species names.
